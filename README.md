# MERN Stack Book Library Project
The Book Library Project utilizes the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) to implement a working library in a web browser. Created using a tutorial by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA), the project serves as my first interaction with full stack development and was used to gain familiarity with the various components used.
